The demo offers an identification system for live speech into five Arabic dialects namely; Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) - which is the de facto of the Arabic language, Egyptian dialect, Levantine dialect, Moroccan dialect, and Gulf dialect. The demo is based on work done by (Shon & Ali, 2017). The dialect identification is done in two stages namely, Automatic Speech Recognition and then dialect identification. Throughout 2017 Multi-Genre Broadcast challenge (MGB-3), Shon & Ali, 2017 used different techniques for dialect identification where they use either acoustic features, linguistic features or both and includes multiple approaches to address the challenging with the best primary system achieving 75% accuracy on the official 10hr test set. Such best system exploits both acoustic features represented by 400 i-vector features (based on bottleneck feature inputs for their frame-level acoustic representation) and linguistic features that includes character features and phoneme features. However, due to that i-vector features extraction is very computationally expensive, a model based on only linguistic features (words) has been trained to be used in this demo.  
As for the model, a feature vector consists of word counts for each utterance is constructed. Then to further distinguish speech from different Arabic dialects, while making a speech from the same dialect more similar, we adopted a Siamese Neural Network architecture (Bromley & Bentz, 1993) based on word count feature vectors constructed previously.
